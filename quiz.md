1. Polymorphism means many forms from the Greek works 'Poly' meaning many and 'Morph' meaning change.
2. In programming an instance of a class can be treated as if it is also another class/type at the same time.
3. We can create an interface which allows our classes(objects) to be brought together.
4. We can create as many interfaces as we desire.
5. In a class we create an ArrayList and we want to add different types to the ArrayList but they need to be the same type.
Polymorphism would allow us to treat anything we add to the ArrayList as the same type.
This can be done by creating an interface which is inherited by different classes. We then have a single ArrayList where the type is the interface.

6. Composition is when we compose objects from other objects to allow us the functionality we need.
7. We have two classes, one class is Rugby Team and the other class is Rugby Players. The Rugby Team class is composed of Rugby Players.
8. Where we have inheritance and we can't get the behaviour we need without breaking the hierarchy.
9. Using a Strategy Pattern and by setting an interface, allows the behaviours to remain intact after an object is destroyed.
